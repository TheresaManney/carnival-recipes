Jamie's Mac-n-Cheese Pizza
--------------------------
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 white onion, finely chopped
2 cups whole milk
1 store-bought pizza dough, rolled out and spread on a well-oiled baking sheet
1/2 pound dried rotini pasta

6 slices thick-cut good quality bacon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 bone-in chicken breast halves, skinless
1 tablespoon hot (Madras) curry powder
1 (10 ounce) can coconut milk

=======

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
3. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.
5. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and add the butter. Add the onions, garlic and nutmeg.
6. Stir in curry powder.
8. Continue to cook until you have a blond roux, about 5 minutes.
9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
10. Crumble the bacon and add half to the sauce. Mix in the Cheddar and mozzarella.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.
15. Remove from the oven and set down. Spread the macaroni and cheese on the pizza, being careful to leave a 1-inch border.
16. Sprinkle with the breadcrumb mixture on the macaroni and cheese and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.
